Once upon a time there was an abandoned shoe in the middle of a forest. This shoe had been lost sometime ago. 
One day a tiny mouse comes along and decides to make this shoe his home.
The house was very happy with his new house.
He decorated it, stored his food in it, and invited all of his mouse friends over once a week.
Life couldn't be better for the mouse.
This was all taken away from him when the local farmer went looking for his shoe.
The farmer found his shoe while the mouse was away looking for food.
The farmer shook it out and took it home with him.
