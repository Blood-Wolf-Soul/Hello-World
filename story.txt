Once upon a time there was an abandoned shoe in the middle of a forest. This shoe had been lost sometime ago. 
One day a tiny mouse comes along and decides to make this shoe his home.
The house was very happy with his new house.
He decorated it, stored his food in it, and invited all of his mouse friends over once a week.
Life couldn't be better for the mouse.
This was all taken away from him when the local farmer went looking for his shoe.
The farmer found his shoe while the mouse was away looking for food.
The farmer shook it out and took it home with him.

When the mouse finished and went back home, he cound not find the shoe anywhere.
He asked all his friends and a bird told him the farmer took this shoe away.
He was so angry because the bad man took his house, so he decided to get this shoe back.
He went to the farmer's house and he found no one was there, as well as that shoe. So he decided to wait until the farmer came back.
While waiting for him, the mouse visited the farmer's house and found a small necklace on the floor. 
That's his sister's necklace! His sister was lost one month ago and no one saw her anymore. 
He missed his sister a lot.
He thought it must be the farmer who killed her sister. So he decided to revenge on this farmer.(Elaine Wu)

He rallied the other mice.
In the dead of night, they marched to the farmer's land.
They devoured the farmer's rations.
They destroyed the farmer's field.
They spread plague to farmer and watch as he spread it to other humans.
The year was 1347.
